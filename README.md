2,  Patient information managment system
3, Route Planner: The provided C++ code implements a simple route planner that allows users to manage routes between locations, find paths using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. The program uses a graph data structure to represent the routes and their distances. Below is a detailed explanation of the code, including the purpose of each class, method, and key lines of code.
